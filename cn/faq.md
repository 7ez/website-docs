- **我没收到激活邮件, 我没法激活我的账号!**
- 我们根本不需要激活邮件. 你要激活账号, 登录游戏就行了. 你可以在 [连接教程](/doc/connection_guide) 找到所有的步骤.

-----------------------

- **我的杀毒软件拦截了服务器切换器**
- 因为切换器要修改 'hosts' 文件. 关掉杀毒软件, 再试一次.

-----------------------

- **尝试连接服务器的时候提示 "Connection failed" (连接失败)**  
- 点击服务器切换器的 "Inspect" 按钮并确保所有提示都是绿色的 ([像这样](https://i.ibb.co/68TL6zT/Settings-Form.png)). 如果问题仍然没有解决, 加入我们的 [Discord](https://discord.gg/akatsuki) 让我们来帮你.

-----------------------

- **I get "Bancho authentication failed" (wrong password) when I try to log in, but my password is correct!**  
- First, make sure you're connected to Akatsuki (the server switcher should report "You're playing on Akatsuki") and that your password is corrected. If so, type your username and password, then press the **login** button with your mouse. I know, it's weird but it often works. *(make also sure that caps lock is disabled if your password is lowercase)*

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps from osu!direct.**
- Unranked beatmaps can't be downloaded from our beatmap mirror due to technical reasons.

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps when I'm in multiplayer, but I can download them from the main menu**
- Disable **Automatically start osu!direct downloads** from the options and try again. Alternatively, you can use the `!b` command in `#multiplayer` and `#spectator` to get a download link for the current beatmap.

-----------------------

- **How do I play on the normal osu! again?**
- Close osu!, run the switcher and click the **Switch to osu!** button

-----------------------

- **My switcher is off but when I open osu.ppy.sh in my browser I get an error or I get redirected to Akatsuki's website!**
- Make sure the switcher is off, then empty your browser cache and restart your browser. [Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+empty+browser+cache) if you don't know how to do it.

-----------------------

- **I get strange errors on osu!'s website after playing on Akatsuki (beatmaps not found etc)**
- Delete `s` and `t` cookies relative to osu.ppy.sh using a [cookie editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg). If you don't know how to remove specific cookies, just delete all cookies from your browser settings.

-----------------------

- **Can I keep playing while the server is restarting because it's updating?**
- Yes, your scores will be sent as soon as the server gets back online (usually less than a minute). Just make sure to not close the client.

-----------------------

- **Is there a patcher for Akatsuki?**
- No, you can change server by editing the hosts file with our switcher. [Instructions here](https://akatsuki.pw/doc/1).

-----------------------

- **Can I have Akatsuki's source code?**
-  Akatsuki is mostly open source, you can see it [here](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/).

-----------------------

- **Why are osu!direct and other in-game supporter perks free?**
- We think that osu! direct is very cool and it's a shame people have to pay to have it, that's why we're offering it for free on Akatsuki. If you like what we do, please consider a [donation](/donate)

-----------------------

- **My problem is not listed here**
- Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/akatsuki) and ask your question in the #help channel of the server.
