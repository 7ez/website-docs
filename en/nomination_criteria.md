# Nomination Process
Maps that are currently submitted on [official server](https://osu.ppy.sh) but don't have any nomination statuses can receive custom ones on Akatsuki. If a player is interested in having a map go through an evaluation process, they must send it to their respective mode in the Nomination Request category on [Discord](https://akatsuki.gg/discord):

- `#nomination-std`: Available for osu! [standard](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu!) maps;
- `#nomination-taiko`: Available for osu! [taiko](https://osu.ppy.shwiki/en/Game_mode/osu!taiko) maps;
- `#nomination-ctb`: Available for osu! [catch the beat](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu!catch) maps;
- `#nomination-mania`: Available for osu! [mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Game_mode/osu!mania) maps;

Once the map set is sent and a Beatmap Nominator is available, they will decide whether the map is worth being **Ranked**, **Loved**, or should remain **Unranked**. If a player is not satisfied about a mapset’s given status, or would like to report one that doesn’t follow the current criteria that has been given a status by mistake, they must forward it to the `#rank-discussion` channel.

# Nomination Statuses
Here are the currently available nomination status on the server, with their respective purpose:

- **Ranked**: Ranked beatmaps use the **double upwards chevron icon** in the song selection screen. They allow players to compete on leaderboards and gain performance points from setting scores. This status is applied by either the Beatmap Nomination team, or the official server.
- **Approved**: Approved beatmaps use the **check mark icon** in the song selection screen. They're part of an old nomination system used by the official server, and allow players to compete on leaderboards and gain performance points from setting scores. This status can only be applied by the official server.
- **Qualified**: Qualified beatmaps use the **check mark icon** in the song selection screen. They enter a queue, and will eventually be Ranked if they aren't disqualified from it. On Akatsuki, once a map is moved from **Qualified** to **Ranked**, the scores submitted within the qualification period remain. This status is currently only applied by the official server.
- **Loved**: Loved beatmaps use the **heart icon** in the song selection screen. Unlike Ranked beatmaps, they do not award performance points from setting scores. This status is applied by either the Beatmap Nomination team, or the official server.
- **Unranked**: Unranked beatmaps use the **question mark icon** in the song selection screen. They don’t offer any leaderboards nor allow the player to gain any performance points from setting scores, their only benefit is to increment a player’s total score. This is the default given status for beatmaps.

# Nomination Criteria
Here is the currently available nomination criteria for the server. Due to the diversity of game modes, it may differ for each and every one of them.

## What makes a map get ranked?
- Maps that contain good overall consistency.

## What makes a map get loved?
- Maps that aren't timed accurately.
- Maps that blatantly abuse the performance system.
- Maps with 2B or Aspire aspects. Exceptions can be given:
  - They can be ranked as long as they don't break the performance or score submission system.
- Maps that are deemed unrankable but have a lot of traction.
- Maps with hit objects or invisible sliders that cannot be hit.
- Maps that are low quality and are deemed to be very low effort.
- Sets with Difficulty edits. These will vary on the case, for instance:
  - If a set contains different BPM edits, the original BPM can be ranked while others must be loved. 
  - If a set contains different AR edits, the highest AR edit can be ranked while others must be loved. 

## What makes a map not get nominated at all?
- Maps that have official server beatmap nominators. It is best to wait for any updates from their side before requesting them here.
- Maps that are currently marked as WIP or Pending on the official server. Exceptions can be given:
  - If you've contacted the mapper and they've confirmed they won't be committing any more changes to the map.
  - If you're the mapper and you're requesting your own map to be nominated.
- Maps that include unnecessary derogatory terms, or NSFW (not safe for work) content.
- Maps that have been submitted without a mapper's authorization.
- Maps that aren't finished. Exceptions can be given:
  - If they contain a "proper" beginning and ending.
- Maps that are an evident copy of other maps.
- Maps that trigger ScoreV2.


# Akatsuki's osu!mania Ranking Criteria
This document outlines the official ranking criteria for osu!mania on this private server. It specifies the requirements for beatmaps to be considered for ranking or the 'Loved' category. Our goal is to maintain quality standards and fairness in the beatmaps promoted within this community. 

(*Criteria might be adjusted and updated at any time.*)

## Rankable Beatmap Criteria
#### General Requirements
- **Bancho's default rules** (except drain time rule)
- **Minimum Length**: Each beatmap must be at least 30 seconds long.
- **Pattern and Mapping Techniques**: Acceptable patterns and techniques should be fair and not exploitative in terms of performance points (pp). (*Benchmark: Bancho's acceptance of pp-abuse, plus a bit more*)

#### Special Effects
- **Scroll Velocity (SV) Changes**: SV changes are allowed if they are structured, meaningful, and readable.

## Non-Rankable Criteria
- **Prohibited Patterns and Maps**: The following patterns are not allowed due to their potential for pp abuse or lack of quality:
  - **Vibro** patterns
  - **4/3-3/4** patterns or any of that kind
  - **Long (LN) Rolls/ Trills**, especially when used excessively to inflate pp
  - **Inverse/FLN** maps
  - **Gimmick** and **Memory Maps**: Maps focused on gimmicks or requiring memorization are not allowed in the ranked section.
  - **Sets** with **Different Rates/BPM**, the original may be ranked.
  - Maps that are deemed unrankable but have a **lot of traction**.
  - Maps that aren't timed accurately.

## Non-Loveable Criteria (&rarr;Not Rankable)
- Akatsuki's standard "**What makes a map not get nominated at all?**", plus:
- **Unstructured SV Changes**: SV changes that do not contribute to the map's readability and structure.
- **Dumps** with near to no popularity on Bancho.
- **Low-Quality Beatmaps**: Maps that are deemed to be very low effort.

## Note on current Ranked-Section
Due to historical events, the current ranked-section of Akatsuki contains maps that do not meet these ranking criteria but are still present. These maps are considered temporary exceptions until the Ranked-Section has been thoroughly reviewed and cleaned up.
