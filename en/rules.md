#### _This is how we handle cheaters and multiaccounters on Ripple._

Despite that, **we ARE against cheating**, and will take immediate action on any hacked score.
* Multiaccounts are **NOT** allowed, with the **SOLE EXCEPTION OF CHAT BOTS**.  If you are developing one and need an account for it,  mail [support](mailto:support@ripple.moe) (or a [dev](mailto:howl@ripple.moe))
* We reserve the right to change these rules as we see fit.

<h3><i class="list layout icon"></i> Miscellaneous</h3>

* [Read the next two rules with this song in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBQE_TNI7zw)
* You can change your profile flag mailing [support](mailto:support@ripple.moe), and sending a picture with a valid document and a post-it or a piece of paper with your Ripple name. The documents will be carefully investigated ~~by our border inspector~~.
* If you try to fuck with the support team (e.g. giving a false document), ~~we'll send you back to Kolechia~~ you'll get banned. Easy as that.
