## How to Connect to Akatsuki: Linux 

- Open your osu! launch script.
- If `"$@"` is not already present after `osu!.exe`, add it. For example, modify `wine osu\!.exe` to `wine osu\!.exe "$@"`.
- When launching the script, add `-devserver akatsuki.gg`. For instance, if you typically use `./osu.sh` to launch osu!, run `./osu.sh -devserver akatsuki.gg`.

If you exclusively play on Akatsuki, you can replace `"$@"` with `-devserver akatsuki.gg`. This way, you won't need to type the server address each time you want to play!

## How to Connect to Akatsuki: MacOS

### If you're running `osu!.exe` directly: 
- Look for **EXE Flags** in file properties.
- Add `-devserver akatsuki.gg` to the argument box.
- Save changes then run it normally.
- Enjoy playing osu! on Akatsuki!

### If you're running `osu!.exe` through a bat file (`execute.bat`):
- Open the **bat file** on a file editor.
- Add `-devserver akatsuki.gg` to the same line as `start C:\osu!\osu!.exe`.
- Save changes then run it normally.
- Enjoy playing osu! on Akatsuki!

## How to Return to Bancho:

- Remove the `-devserver akatsuki.gg` command from the shortcut you use to launch osu!.

It is recommended to maintain at least two shortcuts: one for the [official server](https://osu.ppy.sh) and another one for Akatsuki. For security reasons, each time you switch servers, you'll need to re-enter your login credentials.
